# PayPal clone site
A paypal replica website that I had created in order to grasp how CSS grid and flexbox works.

![Demo of site](gif/desktop_view.gif)

## Lessons learned
- Understood and got to apply the fundamentals of CSS grid and flexbox
- Applied CSS custom properties(variables) 

## Replicating all of the files on your local machine
As the files of the website contain CSS and HTML which run without any additional dependencies, you can simply clone the git repo.
```
# Navigate to any folder on your local machine and run
git clone https://github.com/mriusdev/ppal-replica.git
```
